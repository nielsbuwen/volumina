    This class is the 3D widget seen in the bottom right corner in ilastik.

    It is basically a container for the actual 3D view, a busy progress bar and some buttons.
    The buttons are:
        toggle_slice_x: QToolButton, to toggle the display of the x slicing plane
        toggle_slice_y: QToolButton, to toggle the display of the y slicing plane
        toggle_slice_z: QToolButton, to toggle the display of the z slicing plane
        anaglyph: QToolButton, to toggle anaglyph 3D mode (not implemented right now)
        dock: QToolButton, to toggle the docking status of the widget
    The progress bar:
        progress: QProgressBar
        It is used to indicate whether a numpy volume is converted into a mesh right now
    The 3d view:
        view: volumina.view3d.glview.GLView (promoted from QGraphicsView)
        It displays the slicing planes and the labeling in 3d

    slots:
        slice_changed: emitted when the user changes the slicing in the 3d view
        reinitialized: probably obsolete, used to indicate to some containers that this view is ready?
        dock_status_changed: indicates that the dock button was toggled
